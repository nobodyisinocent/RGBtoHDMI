# RGBtoHDMI
The RGBtoHDMI device adds an HDMI output to your AMIGA.
The original RGB2HDMI, designed by c0pperdragon can be found here: https://github.com/c0pperdragon/Amiga-Digital-Video/

# Low profile board based on design from c0pperdragon
Originally, I made my own version since I wanted the smallest possible pcb for my personnal use, and also for the use of a friend.
Actually, There is one version specially designed for the CDTV, an various designs for the A500.
The goal is always the same,having a nice and small board.

# Tiny RGB2HDMI CPLD design
Always with the same goal, as small as possible, this board uses the CPLD design. But, since the configuration menu is accessible with one button, I have removed the 3 buttons, the screen port (no interest for my use) and finally, the JTAG port since the CPLD can be programmed directly from the Pi0

Please note the sources of this board are not available here since the pcb is under production. The Kicad sources & Gerber will be uploaded when the board will be assembled and tested.
